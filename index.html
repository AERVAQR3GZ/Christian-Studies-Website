		<!------THE HISTORY------->

		<section class="history">
			<h1>
				A breif overview of
				<span class="animateoohyea">Cosmological Argument</span>
			</h1>
			<br />
			In the beginning
			<span class="animateoohyea">God made this world,</span>
			<br />
			That is a phrase that almost every body will recognise, but not all people will get
			behind.
			<br />
			This blog will discuss the Cosmological Argument and show how it has caused me to
			<br />
			believe that Jesus and God are not real, although the reasons to do so are valid and
			applicable.
			<br />
			It has 3 main points:

			<!--This sets it to be a row-->
			<div class="row">
				<!--This is a predifined variable, allowing for ease of editing in mass.-->
				<div class="history-col">
					<h3>Everything has a cause.</h3>
					<p>
						Since we know the
						<span class="animateoohyea">universe was created</span>
						at a finite point in the past, it
						<span class="animateoohyea">must have had a cause</span>
						. Since there was nothing before the universe, the cause must be outside of
						the universe, and God is outside of this universe,
						<span class="animateoohyea">force that is almighty and unworldly.</span>
						a This strongly suggests that
						<span class="animateoohyea">God created the universe.</span>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="history-col">
					<h3>The universe has a cause.</h3>
					<p>
						Since we know the universe is expanding, and thanks to the second law of
						thermo dynamics, we know that the universe is not eternal. This means that
						the
						<span class="animateoohyea">universe must have a cause</span>
						. Since there was nothing before the universe, the cause must have been
						divine, with purpose and intended, which matches perfectly with
						<span class="animateoohyea">God making the universe.</span>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="history-col">
					<h3>God made the universe</h3>
					<p>
						Since the universe has to have a cause, and it can not have caused its self,
						that means that
						<span class="animateoohyea">God created it.</span>
					</p>

		<!---------------WHY PEOPLE LIKE IT----------------->
		<section class="whyitisliked">
			<h1>Limitations</h1>
			<p>
				This argument has a few key limitations, in which I will
				<span class="animateoohyea">cover 3</span>
				.
				<br />
				The main three are the paradox of no time, the
				<span class="animateoohyea">self contradiction</span>
				and the lack of evidence towards which specific thing caused it.
			</p>
			<div class="row">

				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="whyitisliked-col">
					<h3>Infinite "Time"</h3>
					<p>
						Since before the universe was created, there was
						<span class="animateoohyea">no measure of time</span>
						, infinite time could have passed, and with infinite passing time leads to
						some
						<span class="animateoohyea">guaranteed something</span>
						, in fact guaranteed everything, hence the universe!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="whyitisliked-col">
					<h3>Self contradiction</h3>
					<p>
						With the argument that
						<span class="animateoohyea">everything has a cause</span>
						, it brings up the trouble that
						<span class="animateoohyea">God must have had a cause</span>
						. This is one of the clearest and simplest reasons that this argument is
						flawed.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="whyitisliked-col">
					<h3>Why God?</h3>
					<p>
						If the creation of the universe was by some other divine being (and not the
						big bang),
						<span class="animateoohyea">what is saying it has to be God?</span>
						There is no clear point leading us to believe that it must have been God. It
						could have been
						<span class="animateoohyea">any other divine being</span>
						.

			<h1>How it has changed me.</h1>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="reviews-col">
					<img src="images/review-1.jpg" />
					<div>
						<p>
							Before studying this argument, I used to think that the reasons for
							belief in God were nonexistent, and simply used as self-comfort for what
							comes after death.
							<br />
							<br />

							Now I think that there are several well-structured and well formatted
							arguments for and against the existence of God and the origin of the
							universe, yet I still strongly believe that God is not real.

							<br />
							<br />

							Therefore, the argument has made we want to consider Christianity more
							seriously, as it has showed me that there are often believable reasons
							for the existence of God, the validity of Christianity and the existence
							of Jesus. I give this argument a 3/5, as it is easy to understand, yet
							has some critical flaws.
